# Arduino
This repository includes design files for embedded programming in C++ for Automated Devices with Arduino Control. The different design files are defined here:


## Vol
A volume control that can be used to determine somebody’s hearing threshold. A user can start with the volume all the way up and until they no longer hear sound, or start with the volume off and turn up until they do hear the sound

## Blink-Sound

The sound detection test will turn the light on and there will be either a beep from the buzzer or not. The beep will be determined at random.

The user’s hearing threshold is determined using the volume threshold test. Then, the user performs the sound detection test. He is instructed to hit the button when they both hear a noise and see the light turn on.

Hits, Misses, Correct Rejects and False Alarm rates are recorded for the user under all 3 experimental conditions, and data is analyzed.
